# VACTRAC Covid-19 Vaccine Group Tracker Project
VACTRAC Covid-19 Vaccine Group Tracker lets a group manages flexible number of members's Covid-19 vaccine status using webbrower.

The goal is to offer your organization/group/team a Covid-19 Vaccine management solution to plan for, track, contact and report on vaccine status, gain visibility into your team .

The system prompts patients twice per day to submit their own heart rate, body temperature and oxygen saturation via a website. Clinicians are alerted to patients with concerning or critical vitals. Automation keep staff interaction and administrative work minimal.

VACTRAC Covid-19 Vaccine Group Tracker is a [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/software/) (Research Electronic Data Capture tool) project template that you can copy and adapted for your facility. Patients interact with the system via public websites (REDCap *Surveys*).

You may use and adapt this project free of charge, however we ask that you acknowledge this project and the [HSSC](https://www.healthsciencessc.org) in your copy, and any associated academic publications.

REDCap allowed us to rapidly prototype the system in response to the pandemic in early 2021. We hope it will also make the system accessible to organisations facing Covid-19 vaccine pressure but without the resources to build software projects.

## Requirements for using the system

- a [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/software/) installation and license
- a recent enough version of REDCap to support the *Alerts and Notifications Function*
- a [Smile CDR](https://www.smilecdr.com/) installation and license
- a recent enough version of Smile CDR to support the Bulk FHIR and VDX MDM
- a mobile phone that can receive SMS for staff alerts
- an outgoing SMS service (ideally Twilio)
- an outgoing email server and an email address for your staff
- primary contact staff to respond to staff
- primary contact staff to remind covid-19 vaccine appointment
